<h3>Github Exercise</h3>

You are working on a collaborative project with Billy to document superhero 
sightings.  You have been asked to create a text file documenting a sighting
of your favorite superhero and submit it to the github repository using
a pull request.

<ol>
<li>Go to https://github.com/williamrowell/turbo-octo-batman</li>
<li>Fork your own copy of the repository</li>
<li>Clone your forked repository to your computer</li>
<li>Compose a plain text file (see example aquaman-smckay123.txt). 
Make sure your file name is unlikely to be the same as anyone elses, and 
don't use aquaman-smckay123.txt! </li>
<li>Add, commit, push your file back to your forked repository</li>
<li>Submit a pull request asking Billy to add your review to his collection</li>
</ol>
